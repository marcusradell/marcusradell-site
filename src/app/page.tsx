          ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, you have reached Marcus RÃ¥dell, Head of Teaching at{" "}
          <a href="https://salt.dev">https://salt.dev</a>. Please leave a

        <p>
          I&apos;ve also done a bit of live coding as I&apos;m trying to
          collaborate more with people interested in writing quality code:{" "}

          . It&apos;s a topic I hope to contribute more to in the future. You
          can find the code in the code typing repo above, but in the branch{" "}
          <code>final_hexagon</code>. OK, time to stop stalking my GitHub
          profile! Developers, get back to coding! Recruiters, if you contact
          me, be prepared to hear about our great SALT developers (they&apos;re
          better than yours, but I have to charge)!
